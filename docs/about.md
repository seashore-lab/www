# About Seashore Lab

We're building the **infrastructure for the AI-native era** — empowering developers to create intelligent agents that reason, remember, and take action.

## Our Mission

The future of software is AI-native. Applications that can understand context, learn from interactions, and autonomously solve problems. But building these systems shouldn't require a PhD in machine learning or lock you into a proprietary ecosystem.

**Seashore Lab exists to democratize AI agent development.**

We provide the tools, frameworks, and best practices that enable any developer to build production-ready AI agents with TypeScript — the language of the web.

## What We Believe

### **Freedom Matters**

Your AI infrastructure shouldn't be held hostage by any single company's platform. We build on open standards, support multiple LLM providers, and ensure you own your stack.

### **Developers First**

We are developers building for developers. Our frameworks prioritize type safety, great DX, and production-ready patterns over hype and marketing.

### **Pragmatic AI**

Not everything needs AI. We focus on real use cases where agents provide genuine value — customer support, data analysis, workflow automation, content generation.

## The Seashore Framework

Our flagship product, **seashore**, is a modular TypeScript agent framework designed from the ground up for the AI-native application stack.

- **ReAct Agents**: Reasoning and acting in a loop
- **Tool System**: Type-safe, composable tools
- **Workflows**: Visual orchestration of multi-step AI pipelines
- **RAG**: Retrieval-augmented generation with vector search
- **Memory**: Short-term, mid-term, and long-term memory systems
- **MCP**: Model Context Protocol for external integrations
- **GenUI**: React components for generative interfaces
- **Observability**: Tracing, logging, and token counting
- **Evaluation**: Automated testing and quality metrics
- **Security**: Guardrails and content filtering
- **Deploy**: One-command deployment to Cloudflare Workers and Node.js

Built on **@tanstack/ai** — not tied to Vercel, not tied to any SaaS platform.
